                <h3>Is there a warranty if things don't work out?</h3>
                <p>
                    Yes! Every match comes with a 30-day wellness warranty. If your new feathered 
                    friend isn't adjusting well or you have unexpected concerns, we'll work with 
                    you to ensure the best outcome—whether that means extra support, a health check, 
                    or helping you find a better match. Your peace of mind (and your parrot's happiness) matters to us.

                <h3>How does the matching algorithm work?</h3>
                <p>
                    Our algorithm learns your preferences as you swipe—tracking which birds you 
                    like and dislike. It looks for patterns in your choices and compares them with 
                    others who have similar tastes. Over time, it uses this information to recommend 
                    birds you're more likely to match with, making your experience more personalized 
                    with every swipe.

                <h3>Is it easy to own a parrot?</h3>
                <p>
                    Owning a parrot can be incredibly rewarding, but it does take commitment. Parrots 
                    are intelligent, social creatures that need daily interaction, mental stimulation, 
                    and proper care to thrive. While some are low-maintenance, many require time, patience, 
                    and a good understanding of their needs. With the right environment and attention, 
                    owning a parrot can be a joyful and lasting companionship.
